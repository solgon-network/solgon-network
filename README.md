- 🔭 I’m currently working on OSLyricHouse! My first Independent Flutter Application!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dart & Flutter! Setting up all the dependencies in Android Studio took me some time, but I am enjoying the Dart language for sure! Big shout out and thank you to [Ahinav Marwaha](https://github.com/abhinavmarwaha) for the guidance and the opportunity to help develop [LifeHQ](https://github.com/abhinavmarwaha/LifeHQ), an amazing application written in flutter and available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abhinavmarwaha.lifehq), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.abhinavmarwaha.lifehq/), [Microsoft Store](https://github.com/abhinavmarwaha/LifeHQ/releases/download/v0.7.0/lifehq.msix), [GitHub](https://github.com/abhinavmarwaha/lifehq/releases/latest), and the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/lifehq)

- 👯 I’m not looking to collaborate on any projects at the moment, but I am looking to hire a personal Tutor to create the back end of OsLyricHouse.
 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with NetHunter Custom Kernel for the Moto G Stylus (2020/ all variants) And TWRP Recovery Image for The Pixel 5a.
